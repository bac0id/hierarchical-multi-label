# Hierarchical Multi Label(HML)

## Introduction

The attributes of a photo are diverse, including time, location, people, objects, events, etc. 

In most photo album applications, users can add labels to photos (or put photos into different named albums) based on attributes to facilitate photo classification and retrieval. For example, "Japan Travel" and "Food". 

Sometimes, users name labels with a certain hierarchical logic. For example, "Japan Travel" is a sub-label of the "Travel" label. 

However, few photo album applications have sub-label feature. So, our **Hierarchical Multi Label**(**HML**) system is developed.
